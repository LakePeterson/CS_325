# CS 325 Analysis of Algorithms

This repository is an archive of all the programming assignments for CS 325 at Oregon State University taken winter quarter 2020, taught by Maher Elshakankiri and Ali Ebnenasir.

## Course Description

In this course we learned about analyzing algorithms for correctness and running time, Divide and Conquer and the use of recurrences to analyze recursive algorithms. We also learned about Dynamic Programming, Linear programming, NP-Completeness, Heuristics and Approximation Algorithms. By the end of the course, we are able to:

- Use O, Ω, Θand simple recurrences to analyze the time complexity of iterative and recursive algorithms.
- Prove the correctness of algorithms.
- Implement recursive, iterative and heuristic algorithms.
- Prove that a problem is NP-complete using reductions.
